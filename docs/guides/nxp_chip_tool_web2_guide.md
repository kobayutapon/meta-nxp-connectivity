## Building and running the chip-tool-web2

Before using the chip-tool-web2, you must compile it from source on Linux.

> **Note:** To ensure compatibility, you should always build the chip-tool-web2 from the same revision of the `connectedhomeip` repository.

### Building the chip-tool-web2

The steps to compile the chip-tool-web2 are the same as [How to build Matter application](https://github.com/nxp-imx/meta-nxp-connectivity/blob/master/README.md#how-to-build-matter-application)

After compilation, you will find two binaries, chip-tool and chip-tool-web2, in the ${matter}/out/chip-tool-web2/ folder. However, please note that the chip-tool binary in this folder may not work as expected. Therefore, it is recommended not to use the chip-tool binary located in the out/chip-tool-web folder.

### Running the chip-tool-web2

#### Introduction

Before using `chip-tool-web2`, make sure that the i.MX board is properly connected to the Internet.

#### Default Setup

The image built by `meta-nxp-connectivity` includes the `chip-tool` binary in the i.MX SoC `/usr/bin` directory, and all frontend files are already copied to `/usr/share/chip-tool-web/frontend2`. Therefore, to use `chip-tool-web2`, you only need to copy the newly compiled `chip-tool-web2` binary to the `/usr/bin` directory.

#### Custom Setup

If you want to specify a custom location for the frontend files, you can follow these steps:
- Copy the `frontend2` file to the desired location:
    ```
    $ cp ${matter}/examples/chip-tool/webui-2_0/frontend2 $frontend_path
    ```
- Export the `CHIP_TOOL_WEB_FRONTEND` variable and set it to the path of the frontend files:
    ```
    $ export CHIP_TOOL_WEB_FRONTEND=$frontend_path
    ```
- If you want to make this variable persistent across sessions, add the above command to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`).

#### Verification

After completing the setup, run the following command to verify that `chip-tool-web2` is working properly:
```
$ chip-tool-web2
```

If you see the following logs: `CHIP:DL: CHIP task running` and `CHIP:TOO: LWS_CALLBACK_ESTABLISHED`, everything is working fine.

#### Accessing the chip-tool-web2

The `chip-tool-web2` can run on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. To access the `chip-tool-web2`, follow these steps:

- Open a web browser (such as Chrome, etc.) on the device you want to use.
- Enter the IP address of the i.MX board followed by `:8889` in the address bar of the browser. You can find the IP address of the i.MX board by running the `ifconfig` command on the board.
- You will see the `chip-tool-web2` home page. Follow the instructions in the [section](#using) to proceed.

#### Example of opening on Windows

Here is an example of opening `chip-tool-web2` on Windows using Chrome:

<img src="../images/chip-tool-web2/chip-tool-web2_home.png" alt="Alt text" width="500"/>

> **Note:** The network connected to the running device must be on the same segment as the i.MX device.

## Using chip-tool-web2 to commission a Matter device

This section provides instructions for using chip-tool-web2 to commission Matter devices, with a focus on the chip-lighting-app application clusters on i.MX MPU platforms.

It should be noted that while chip-tool-web2 provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for executing commands through buttons and other visual controls, it does not completely replace the chip-tool command line tool. Users can still use the chip-tool command line tool if they prefer or need to, but chip-tool-web2 provides an additional option for interacting with Matter devices. The following sections will provide a detailed overview of the features currently available in chip-tool-web2.

An official Matter document explaining how to use chip-tool as a Matter controller, can be found [here](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/chip_tool_guide.md).

For more information on how to use Matter applications on i.MX MPU platforms, see the [NXP Matter demos guide](./nxp_mpu_matter_demos.md).

### Using Interactive mode

The chip-tool offers two modes of operation: `Single Command Mode` and `Interactive Mode`, each with unique features and appropriate use cases. For detailed information about these modes, please refer to the official documentation available at [Interactive mode versus single-command mode](
https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/chip_tool_guide.md#interactive-mode-versus-single-command-mode).

It should be noted that chip-tool-web2 uses the `Interactive Mode` to allow users to conveniently send multiple commands through the web interface and to improve the management of Matter devices.

### Commissioning a Matter device

The chip-tool-web2 supports four commissioning types: "Add Thread Device", "Add WI-FI Device", "Add OnNetwork Device" and "Add Device by QRCode". You can start commissioning by clicking the corresponding buttons in the GUI header to start commissioning.

#### Add Thread Device

Click on the `Add Thread Device` button. Enter the `Device ID`, `Device Code`, `Device Alias` and `Device Bluetooth Discriminator`, then, click the button `Get Dataset` to get the Open Thread dataset (Make sure you run the otbr-agent in the i.MX device and the wpan0 interface is up before getting the dataset). Then you can click the `Send Command` to trigger the command to commission the device to the existing Thread network:

```
$ chip-tool pairing ble-thread <node_id> hex:<dataset> <pin_code> <discriminator>
```
In this command:

-   _<node_id\>_ is the user-defined device ID of the node being commissioned.
-   _<dataset\>_ is the Operational Dataset.
-   _<pin_code\>_ and _<discriminator\>_ are device-specific keys.

> **Note:** When entering the _<dataset>_,  there is no need to add the `hex:` prefix, as this is already added by default in the chip-tool-web backend.

To obtain the Open Thread dataset, you can either form the OpenThread network manually by following the instructions provided in the [Configure OpenThread Network](./nxp_mpu_matter_demos.md#configure-openthread-network), or via otbr-web.

#### Add WI-FI Device

Click on the `Add WI-FI Device` button. Enter the `Device ID`, `Device Code`, `Device Alias`, `Network SSID`, `Network Password` and `Device Bluetooth Discriminator`. Then, click the `Send Command` to trigger the command to commission the device to the existing Wi-FI network:

```
$ chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <node_id> <ssid> <password> <pin_code> <discriminator>
```
In this command:

-   _<node_id\>_ is the user-defined device ID of the node being commissioned.
-   _<ssid\>_ and _<password\>_ are credentials.
-   _<pin_code\>_ and _<discriminator\>_ are device-specific keys.

#### Add OnNetwork Device

Click on the `Add OnNetwork Device` button. Enter the `Device ID`, `Device Code`, `Device Alias`. Then, click the `Send Command` to trigger the command to discover devices and attempt to pair with the first discovered one using the provided setup code:

## Binding for light and switch Matter device

Binding describes a relationship between the device that contains the binding cluster and the end device. The chip-tool-web2 supports binding a light in one light_switch_combo device to the switch in another light_switch_combo device, allowing the light in another device to be controlled by the switch of one device.

To access the `Binding` function in the chip-tool-web2, click `Binding` button on sidebar. The following interface will be displayed:

<img src="../images/chip-tool-web2/chip-tool-web2_binding.png" alt="Alt text" width="500"/>

### Write ACL

First, the light_switch_combo application should run properly on the K32W Matter device, and then use the chip-tool-web2 ble-thread pairing method to commission with two light_switch_combo devices separately.

Two light-switch_combo devices, one used as the switch device and the other used as the light device. Before binding, the access control list must be written. Therefore, in the `Write ACL` section, enter the `Lighting Node Alias (Options)`, `Lighting Node ID` of the light_switch_combo device which play as lighting device, enter the `Switch Node Alias (Options)`, `Switch Node ID` of the light_switch_combo device which play as switch device, `ACL EndPoint ID` is recommended to use endpoint `0`. Then click the `Write ACL` button to trigger write acl command like below.
```
chip-tool accesscontrol write acl <acl_data> <node_id> <endpoint_id>
```
In this command:

-   _<acl_data\>_ is the ACL data formatted as a JSON array. Here is the `'[{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 5, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [112233], "targets": null },{"fabricIndex": 1, "privilege": 3, "authMode": 2, "subjects": [<Switch Node Id>], "targets": null }]'`.
-   _<node_id\>_ is the ID of the node that is going to receive ACL. Here is <Light node ID\>.
-   _<endpoint_id\>_ is the ID of the endpoint on which the `accesscontrol`
    cluster is implemented. 0 means all endpoints.

For more details, you can refer to [access control guide](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/access-control-guide.md).

### Write Binding

After trigger the write access list command, you can click the `Write Binding` button to binding the Light and Switch device，it will trigger the command:
```
$ chip-tool binding write binding <binding_data> <node_id> <endpoint_id>
```
In this command:

-   _<binding_data\>_ is the binding data formatted as a JSON array. Here is `[{"fabricIndex": 1, "node": <Light NodeId>, "endpoint": <Light EndPoint ID>, "cluster": 6}]'`.
-   _<node_id\>_ is the ID of the node that is going to receive the binding. Here is <Switch node ID\>.
-   _<endpoint_id\>_ is the ID of the endpoint on which the `binding` cluster is
    implemented. Here is the <Switch EndPoint ID\> of the switch device.

After the binding command is successfully executed, press SW2 two times on the device acting as Switch to register the binding entry, and then you can control the light (D3) on the peer device (light device) just by pressing SW2/SW3.

## Opening the commissioning window for the commissioned Matter device

Multi-admin feature allows you to join Matter device to multiple Matter fabrics and have multiple different Matter administrators administer it. Chip-tool-web2 supports the Basic Commissioning Method (BCM) and Enhanced Commission Method (ECM) to open the commissioning window of i.MX Matter device for a new administrator from another fabric.

Click the `Multi-Admin` button in sidebar, the following interface will be displayed:

<img src="../images/chip-tool-web2/chip-tool-web2_multiadmin.png" alt="Alt text" width="500"/>

Enter `Node ID`, `Option`, `Window Timeout`, `Iteration` and `Discriminator`. Then, click `Open Commissioning Window with BCM` (when `Option` is 0) or `Open Commissioning Window with ECM` (when `Option` is 1) button to trigger the Open Commissioning window:
```
$ chip-tool pairing open-commissioning-window <node_id> <option> <window_timeout> <iteration> <discriminator>
```
In this command:

-   _<node_id\>_ is the ID of the node that should open commissioning window.
-   _<option\>_ is equal to `0` for BCM and `1` for ECM.
-   _<window_timeout\>_ is time in seconds, before the commissioning window closes.
-   _<iteration\>_ is number of PBKDF iterations to use to derive the PAKE verifier.
-   _<discriminator\>_ is device specific discriminator determined during commissioning.

When using the ECM, there will show a manul pairing code and QRCode like below in web interface. Then you can add this device on another administrator by [`Add Device by QRCode`](#add_qrcode). 

<img src="../images/chip-tool-web2/chip-tool-web2_ECM_QRCode.png" alt="Alt text" width="500"/>

Besides, you can then commission the Matter device to a new fabric using another instance of the CHIP tool by below command.
```
$ chip-tool pairing code <node_id> <payload>
```
In this command:

-   _<node_id\>_ is the user-defined device ID of the commissioned node.
-   _<payload\>_ is the QR code payload or a manual pairing code generated by the first commissioner instance when opened commissioning window. If you used the BCM to open commissioning window, the manual pairing code should be `34970112332`.

    ```
    $ chip-tool energyevse read session-duration <node_id> <endpoint_id>
    ```

#### Report Format

The EEVSE read report is output in text format with the following structure:
```
Report from ${nodealias} ${nodeid}:${endpoint}. Cluster:${cluster}
${attribute}:${value}
```
In the structure above,

- ${nodealias}: The node alias of the device.
- ${nodeid}: The nodeid of the device.
- ${endpoint}: The endpoint of the device.
- ${cluster}: The cluster name to which the device belongs.
- ${attribute}: The name of the attribute being reported. In this case, the default attributes are `state`, `supplystate`, `faultstate`, `chargingenableduntil`, `minimumchargecurrent`, `maximumchargecurrent`, `sessionid`, `sessionduration`.
- ${value}: The value of the attribute.

## Additional Notes

- Deleting the `/tmp/chip_tool_config.ini` file and any other `.ini` files in the `/tmp` directory may help to resolve problems caused by outdated configuration.
Running `rm -rf /tmp/chip_*` will remove these files. This will allow the chip-tool-web2 to rebuild its configuration files from scratch.

- The timeout for buttons in the chip-tool-web2 that execute commands is set to default timeout, e.g. 125 seconds for pairing buttons and 20 seconds for cluster read buttons. During the command execution process, the interface will display the command execution waiting effect. Please wait patiently for the command to finish executing and return a result of `success` or `failed`.

- In general, commands related to `Pairing` may take longer to execute, while commands related to `OnOff` functionality will execute faster. If a pairing command takes a long time to execute and returns with `failed`, please check that the device configuration follows the [documentation](./nxp_mpu_matter_demos.md). Also, try pairing again after running `rm -rf /tmp/chip_*`.

- The chip-tool-web2 supports commissioning multiple devices at the same time. Note that you should not run `rm -rf /tmp/chip_*` while commissioning multiple devices at once, as this will erase the useful information of the successfully paired devices.

- The chip-tool-web2 only supports commissioning devices with a decimal node ID, not a hexadecimal one.

- New features are still being developed and expanded.
