# Running Matter demos on i.MX MPU platforms

This document describes how to use the MATTER-NCP demos on the i.MX MPU platforms. It shows how to run MATTER-NCP demos on the i.MX MPU platform and how to do wifi-bt commissioning between chip-tool and chip-all-clusters-app-ncp apps.

## Hardware requirements

- Two i.MX8M Mini EVK boards (one board will act as the Matter controller, running chip-tool, and the other will be the end device, running the chip-all-clusters-app-ncp apps.)

The i.MX8M Mini EVK which running the chip-all-clusters-app-ncp apps connect with RDRW612 as the connection of ncp-host and ncp-device.

- RDRW612 A2 BGA board

The RDRW612 acts as ncp-device, and ensure the BLE antenna is connected to RDRW612 board to prevent the BLE disconnection during BLE pairing. 

## Verification about ble-wifi commissioning

Set up BT and connect to a wifi AP on controller device (DUT running chip-tool)
- step1. Save Wi-Fi SSID and Password to a file.

    $ wpa_passphrase ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} > wifiap.conf

- step2. Setup BT and connectd to a WiFi AP.

    $modprobe moal mod_para=nxp/wifi_mod_para.conf
    $wpa_supplicant -d -B -i mlan0 -c ./wifiap.conf
    $sleep 5
    $udhcpc -i mlan0
    $modprobe btnxpuart
    $hciconfig hci0 up

Run the example application on the end device, the following example uses an USB interface.

    $ export NCP_PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0, and for sdio: export NCP_PORT=/dev/mcu-sdio
    $ ./chip-all-clusters-app-ncp-usb --wifi --ble-device 0

For other interfaces (spi, sdio and uart):

    $ ./chip-all-clusters-app-ncp-spi --wifi --ble-device 0
    $ ./chip-all-clusters-app-ncp-sdio --wifi --ble-device 0
    $ ./chip-all-clusters-app-ncp-uart --wifi --ble-device 0

Do commissioning and control the end devices on the controller device.

    $ ./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 8888 ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} 20202021 3840

If you can see that the IP address is obtained on the device (all-cluster-app) side, it proves that the device has already connected to the external AP.

    [1748353915.770112][551:551] CHIP:DL: Got IP address on interface: ncp_wlan IP: 192.168.0.188

Then the controller and device will setup IP communication by case handshake, after that if you can see below log, it means the commissioning process is successfully complete.

    CHIP:TOO: Device commissioning completed with success

## Matter chip-tool control chip-all-clusters-app-ncp apps after matter commission successfully

read onoff status

    $ chip-tool onoff read on-off 8888 1

we can see this log in chip-tool console log. OnOff reflects on onoff status, the value should be FALSE before enable OnOff. 

    [2025-05-22 14:25:04.603] [1747865814.155617][647:649] CHIP:TOO:   OnOff: FALSE

toggle to enable onoff

    $ chip-tool onoff toggle 8888 1

read onoff status again
    $ chip-tool onoff read on-off 8888 1

we can see this log in chip-tool console log. OnOff reflects on onoff status, the value should be TRUE after enable OnOff. 

    [2025-05-22 14:25:04.603] [1747865814.155617][647:649] CHIP:TOO:   OnOff: TRUE
